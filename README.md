# Sentiment-analysis-on-Airline-Flight-Data
In our project, we are conducting a thorough analysis of the Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset from Kaggle to uncover sentiment outcomes related to airline services. This dataset includes a collection of tweets from February 2015, which are labelled to reflect positive, negative, or neutral sentiments expressed by customers. We acquired this dataset from Kaggle, a well-known platform for data science and machine learning, which provides a wide variety of datasets for analysis.

We will analyse the Twitter Airline Sentiment dataset using TextBlob and VADER for sentiment analysis, which allow us to assess sentiment polarity and subjectivity effectively. To enhance our analysis, we will implement various machine learning algorithms, including the BERT Model, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Machine, Naive Bayes, and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost). With the models with the most accuracy, the dataset will be tested and trained to provide the output of the sentiment analysis. By combining these tools, we aim to gain comprehensive insights into customer perceptions of airline services in February 2015, ultimately providing actionable recommendations for improving service quality and passenger satisfaction.
